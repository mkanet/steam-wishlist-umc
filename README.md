# Steam Wishlist for Home Assistant

A custom component that keeps track of when games on your Steam wishlist are on
sale. This component uses the config flow and can easily be configured via the
Integrations section in the UI.

## Pre-Installation

Prior to installing this integration you must first ensure that your wishlist is publicly
viewable. To do this, login to you steam account and edit your profile. Under the
`Privacy Settings` tab, set `Game Details` to `Public`. Without this step, this integration
will not be able to parse your wishlist.

## Displaying in Lovelace

You are able to use any card or custom card to show a list of your games that are
on sale by utilizing the `sensor.steam_wishlist`. Additionally you can use the
[nintendo-wishlist-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/nintendo-wishlist-card)
to display the games on sale from your Steam wish list. This is possible because
I maintain this integration as well as the [nintendo-wishlist integration](https://github.com/custom-components/sensor.nintendo_wishlist), and the way they store their attributes
in sensors is identical. So if you install the card you add it to lovelace like so:

```yaml
- type: custom:nintendo-wishlist-card
  entity: sensor.steam_wishlist_978793482343112
  title: Steam Wishlist
  image_style: backgroundart
  max: 10
```
